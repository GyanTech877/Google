Two MIT math grads bump into each other at Fairway on the upper west side. They haven’t seen each other in over 20 years.

The first grad says to the second: “how have you been?”
Second: “great! i got married and i have three daughters now”
First: “really? how old are they?”
Second: “well, the product of their ages is 72, and the sum of their ages is the same as the number on that building over there..”
First: “right, ok.. oh wait.. hmm, i still don’t know”
Second: “oh sorry, the oldest one just started to play the piano”
First: “wonderful! my oldest is the same age!”
How old are the daughters?
Respond with daughter ages sorted in ascending order and concatenated together. No spaces.


Answer:->

Ages can be 
2,2,8 =>  22
2,4,9 =>  15
2,12,3 => 17
2,6,6 =>  14
4,6,3 =>  13
8,3,3 =>  14

as we can see for two of them sum is 14. So after seeing building number as 14 the Second person cannot decide the answer.
But as one daughter is oldest, so the answer is 8,3,3
